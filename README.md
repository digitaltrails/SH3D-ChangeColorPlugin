# SH3D-ChangeColorPlugin

This plugin provides a dialog with two standard Java Swing color choosers for selecting a from-color and a to-color. 
The plugin tracks down and changes colors for walls, floors, and furnature. 
The choosers include a tab for "Colors in use" that displays a swatch for each color used in the model. 
Each color in-use swatch includes a hover tooltip that lists where the color is used.
